<p><details><summary><b>Can you have default parameters in the structs?</b></summary><p>

No. The best you can do is have a helper function set the defaults.

```c
void foo_default(struct foo *f)
{
    f->a = 10; // Set defaults
    f->b = 20;
    f->c = 30;
}
```

```c
struct foo x;

foo_default(&x); // Set defaults

x.a = 99; // Override default
```

When you declare a `struct`, you can also use an initializer to set the field
values:

```c
struct foo x = { .a = 10, .b = 20, .c = 30 };
```

<p><details><summary><b>Why does unsigned char type accept a number when it's clearly referring to a character?</b></summary><p>

Deep down, computers just deal in numbers (`1`s and `0`s). They don't know what
a character is. We humans have come up with a system wherein a number
_represents_ a certain character. For example, we've agreed that `A` is `65`.

(For information on what number represents what character, look up more detail
on [ASCII](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII) encoding, or its modern superset
[UTF-8](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UTF-8).)

With that in mind, C really only deals in numbers. Even when you put a character
in single quotes, it's still just a number. The only difference is in how we
_interpret_ that number. That is, is it a value, like 65, or is it a character,
like `A`?

```c
unsigned char c = 'A';

printf("%c\n", c); // Prints "A"
printf("%d\n", c); // Prints 65
```

```c
unsigned char c = 'A';
int x = c + 10;

printf("%d", x); // Prints 75, since 'A' == 65
```

In C, whenever you have a character in single quotes like `'A'`, the compiler
treats it just like you'd put the number `65` there. (Or `66` for `'B'`, and so
on.)

The only difference between `unsigned char` and `unsigned int` is the number of
bytes that are used to represent the number. A `char` is one byte, and an `int`
is typically 4 bytes (but not always).

You can think of these additional bytes as analogous to adding more digits to
your numbers. The more digits you have, the more range you can store. Two
decimal digits only gets you from 0 to 99, but 8 digits gets you from 0 to
99999999. Similarly, one byte only gets you from 0 to 255, but 4 bytes gets you
from 0 to 4,294,967,295.

If you never needed numbers larger than 255, you could use `unsigned char` for
all your variables! (But since modern computers are at least as fast with `int`s
as they are with `char`s, people just use `int`s.)

<p><details><summary><b>When I pass an array as an argument to a function, when do I use pointer notation and when do I use array notation ?</b></summary><p>

It's a little-known FunFact that C doesn't actually pass entire arrays to
functions. It only passes pointers to the first element in that array.

```c
int a[2000];

// "a" is a pointer to the first element in the array.
// It's the same as &(a[0]).
foo(a);
```

So when you declare your function, you can do any of these:

```c
void foo(int *a)
```
```c
void foo(int a[])
```
```c
void foo(int a[1])
```
```c
void foo(int a[2000])
```
```c
void foo(int a[999999999])
```

and it treats them all as if you'd used:

```c
void foo(int *a)
```

There's a difference if you want to use multidimensional arrays. You must
declare all the dimensions except the first one, which is optional. The compiler
needs to know the other dimensions so it can do its array indexing computations
correctly.

```c
int foo(int x[][30]) // 30 wide
{
    return x[2][4];
}

int main(void)
{
    int a[10][30]; // 30 wide

    foo(a);
```

This only applies for multidimensional arrays. For 1-dimensional arrays, the
rule still applies; you still need to specify all dimensions except the first
one... but since there is only one, you never need to specify it.

<p><details><summary><b>Why do functions tend to return pointers to structs, and not just copies of the struct?</b></summary><p>

It's possible to do this:

```c
struct foo my_func(void)
{
    struct foo f;

    f.x = 10;

    return f; // Return a copy of f
}
```

as opposed to:

```c
struct foo *my_func(void)
{
    struct foo *p = malloc(sizeof(struct foo));

    p->x = 10;

    return p; // Return a copy of p
}
```

But in C, it's more idiomatic to return a copy of the pointer to the memory
allocated than it is to return a copy of the `struct` itself.

Part of the reason for this is that it takes time to copy data. A `struct` can
be very large depending on how many fields it has in it, but your average
pointer is only 8 bytes.

Since every time you `return` a thing, a copy of that thing gets made, it is
faster to copy a pointer than it is to copy a `struct` of any non-trivial size.

Finally, note that this variant always invokes undefined behavior and should
never be used:

```c
struct foo *my_func(void)
{
    struct foo f;

    f.x = 10;

    return &f; // Return a copy of a pointer to f
}
```

The reason is because `f` vaporizes as soon as the function returns (since it's
just a local variable), so any pointers to it are invalid.
